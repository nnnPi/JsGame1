# Test

This is the first project i upload.

You could have a look at the 101structure file, which describe the folder structure, lagging behind the frequent update of this newb project.

It need no packages, and no local server to test, just get the files and open index.html in browser.

Main direction:

technical:
=> improve loading of data for async behavior
=> improve communication between different part of the program

logical:
=> add collision detection using layer system
=> when Rightbar code is not ugly, make Leftbar on the same principle

Artistic:
=> moving shadows ?
=> transparency when character being element ?

Ideas:
=> Left bar used in game to access the actions / hotkey
=> Left bar used in Editor for the animal/ennemy logic
