Here i tried to comply with the licenses of the free assets i used when there was such license.

I am grateful for all those sounds and images that made me feel like a kid in a toy store allowed  to take most of the things for free.

I have no license for my own code, i recommend you do a little something positive somewhere one day that'd be good enough.
